		<h3>K2</h3>
		<img src='k2.jpg'/>
		<p>Welcome to K2. It's only the highest mountain in India, don't worry. Not a problem at all. No it's not <i>entirely</i> in India, that's true, you'll have to get permission from the Pakistani government before you'll be permitted to make the climb. But what a climb it is! Almost vertical, in fact. It's a gruelling mountain, there isn't a single horizontal stretch, except a slight shoulder at 2400 feet. Enjoy the sheer rock faces and the vertigo. 80 deaths, 8611 metres. It's a killer mountain. Don't call me a bitch, it's a great trip! Who's going?

		<h3>Kanchenjunga</h3>
		<img src='kanchenjunga.jpg' width='100%' />Allright, allright, so K2 sounded a bit too much like suicide. We've got just the mountain for you. Kanchenjunga has fewer deaths, is slightly lower, and is a teeny tiny bit further away from Pakistan. (65, 8586, and 2841 km) We've got quite a few nice comfortable spots for you to start your leisurely trek. It gets a bit cold, true, and you do have to watch out for altitude sickness. No I am not a bitch, thank you very much. </p>

		<h3>The Northern Himalayas</h3>
		<img src='himalyas.jpg' width='100%' />
		<p> Okay okay, I get the general trend. Not the biggest fan of the Northern part of the Himalayas. Let's look a little bit further south then.

		<h3>Eastern India</h3>
		<img src='northeast.jpg' width='100%' />
		<p>It's the Northeast! Woohoo! Lots of mountains to climb here, there's the nice unassuming Sandakphu-Phalud trek in West Bengal, only a few people die, it gets a bit chilly. But it's not that high, not that dangerous. Seeing a trend here? Watch out for Amsot Peak though, a somewhat high climb (7782 meters). Nothing much to see here. Still too cold for you? No matter. On to lower ground! And stop calling me a bitch.</p>

		<h3>The Western Ghats</h3>
		<img src='anamudi.jpg' width='100%' />
		<p>Here we go. Southern India. Warm, sunny, welcoming with a vast array of wildlife to keep you company. It's the Western Ghats, ladies and gentlemen! It's nice, cozy, only a tiny bit chilly, and not a single death in sight. Naturally, since the mountain is absolutely tiny. Now what's the matter? Oh you want a <i>beach</i>! Why didn't you tell em so? Let's go!

		<h3>Goa</h3>
		<img src='goa.jpg' width='100%' />
		<p>Okay, Goa. Time to sit back and relax. Life is nice. No deaths at sea level, after all. At least, not from climbing. </p>
